     * Problem: Name Sorter
     * Read in the exercise41 input.txt file and sort the list alphabetically
     * Make sure when creating an array list use List<String> for polymorphism aspects
     * Print the sort list to a file called 'exercise41_output.txt'
     *
     * Example Output:
     * Total of 7 names
     * -----------------
     * Johnson, Jim
     * Jones, Aaron
     * Jones, Chris
     * Ling, Mai
     * Swift, Geoffrey
     * Xiong, Fong
     * Zarnecki, Sabrina
     *
     * Constraints: don't hard code the number of names
     *
     * To figure out the number of names you can loop through the text file to see
     * how many \n's there are
